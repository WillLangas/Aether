# PM Sensor

The PM sensor tests for particulates greater than 1 micrometer in length, and outputs a pulse length below 0.7V relative to the number of particles per Liter. This is called a Low Pulse Occupancy Time, and that is how the PM will be calculated. This sensorâ€™s most significant drawback is its lack of precision, but this can be mitigated by averaging the values over a small time period
