# DHT 11 

One sensor measures both temperature and humidity in our case, and provides this data in five 8-bit signals. Using a provided library from Arduino, it will automatically process the data, and all we will have to do is calibrate the sensor to ensure proper values and readings. This sensor should not receive more than 2.5 mA of current, as that will not allow it to properly read the temperature and humidity.
